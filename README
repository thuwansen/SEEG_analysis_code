# SEEG analysis
This repository contains code and demonstrations implementing the "SEEG analysis" representation introduced in:
 《Mapping brain dynamics in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness with a human stereoelectroencephalography resource》


Consciousness Study
------------------------------------------

SEEG is organized in our study with a total of 44 subjects.  

For additional clinical metadata about each subject, refer to the clinical Excel table in the publication.


Data Availability
-----------------
Xiamen Humanity Hospital agreed to share.

All data were approved to be de-identified and shared. All data in this dataset have no identifiers associated with the patient. 


Sourcedata
----------

For each subject, there was a raw EDF file, which was converted into the BrainVision format with `FieldTrip`.

Each subject also has an 'anat' folder which contains 'anat_t1.nii', 'postop_ct.nii', 'glanat.nii' and 'glpostop_ct.nii'. The first two are origin preoperative MRI and postoperative CT. The latter two are MRI and CT which were registered to the MNI template.
Each subject also has 'SEEG_COORDINATE.mat' in 'ieeg' folder. 'SEEG_COORDINATE.mat' contains the coordinates in MNI space of each electrode contact. The corresponding index for AAL atlas was also included. 

Subjects used in the article(《Mapping brain dynamics in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness with a human stereoelectroencephalography resource》) also contain ‘SEEG.mat’, which is the preprocessed data with 0.3~200Hz bandpass filtering and 50Hz notch filtering.



Events and Descriptions
-----------------------
Within each EDF file, there contain event markers that are annotated by clinicians, which may inform you of specific clinical events that are occurring in time. The events were labeled for the consciousness state. Labels such as eyes open, spontaneous breathing, swallow, choking cough were regarded as the return of consciousness.
