## Installation

Download or clone the respository:

```
git clone https://github.com/thuwansen/SEEG_analysis_code
```

Then add the code and dependencies on the MATLAB path, and you will be able to run the demonstrations in this repository.

Usage
-----------------

### Data preparation

All data were from Xiamen Humanity Hospital and were approved to be de-identified and shared. All data in this dataset have no identifiers associated with the patient. The data were publicly available at: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003754.


Demonstration
----------

Four main functions are included in the code. Each of the functions generates the corresponding figure in the article. Each main function contains one initial code section to add the global variables and dependencies and some code sections for the subfigures. 

1. Fig1_main.m

   initial code section

```
% Code for Fig1
clc,clear,close all;
addpath('xxx\toolbox\fieldtrip-20191213');
addpath(genpath('xxx\toolbox\nature_walk_wave'));
addpath('xxx\toolbox\BrainNetViewer_20191031')
code_path = 'xxx\code\functions';
addpath(genpath(codepath);
run([code_path,'\Global_variable_define_LOC2ROC.m']);
fs =500;
color_group = [243/255,164/255,0/255;
               209/255,21/255,71/255;
               39/255,65/255,146/255];
```
